Computer Vision Emotion Detection App
A Python-based application for detecting emotions using computer vision, TensorFlow, Keras, and Tkinter.

Overview
The Computer Vision Emotion Detection App is a machine learning-based application that detects facial emotions in real-time video streams or images. This app leverages the power of deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow and Keras, to classify emotions accurately. The user-friendly interface is built using Tkinter, making it easy to interact with and visualize emotion detection results.

Features
Real-time Emotion Detection: Identifies emotions from a live webcam feed.
Image-based Emotion Analysis: Allows users to upload images for emotion classification.
Emotion Classes: Detects emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Tkinter for seamless user interaction.
Visualization: Displays detected emotions with their respective confidence scores.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for application development.
TensorFlow: Framework for building and deploying deep learning models.
Keras: Simplified API for defining and training neural networks.
OpenCV: Real-time computer vision library for face detection and preprocessing.
Tkinter: Python library for creating the graphical user interface.
How It Works
Face Detection: OpenCV detects faces in the video or image.
Preprocessing: Detected face regions are cropped, resized, and normalized for model input.
Emotion Classification: A pre-trained deep learning model classifies the emotion from the facial features.
Results Visualization: The detected emotion and confidence level are displayed in real-time via the GUI.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras 3.x
OpenCV
Tkinter (bundled with Python)
